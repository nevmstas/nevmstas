### Hi there 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** with 6+ years of experience building web and mobile apps. I enjoy making clean, reliable interfaces and improving the codebases behind them. I'm framework agnostic, comfortable across the stack and often use AI tools to speed up development and solve problems. I like projects where I can take responsibility, simplify things and help the team ship good, solid features
